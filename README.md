# AWS Okta

If you want to know how this works, see the [original README](README.original.md).

## History

[segmentio/aws-okta](https://github.com/segmentio/aws-okta) (forked by) [optimizely/aws-okta](https://github.com/optimizely/aws-okta) (forked by) [skyzyx/aws-okta](https://github.com/skyzyx/aws-okta).

I'll be pulling upstream changes from [optimizely/aws-okta](https://github.com/optimizely/aws-okta). I may make additional changes on my own, and open a PR against the [optimizely/aws-okta](https://github.com/optimizely/aws-okta) fork just so that they don't diverge too much.

## Why?

I need a build that is `brew install`-able, since Homebrew removed [segmentio/aws-okta](https://github.com/segmentio/aws-okta) recently with a [snarky and unhelpful comment](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/23a30f074f551a776465d867b85fdae18a5813d3). Isn't this the whole point of open-source?

## Installation

```bash

```
